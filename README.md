# RTOSscheduler

RTOS Scheduler Implementation - Embedded Systems Project

This is a small C++ Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) scheduler for embedded systems. 
The scheduler manages tasks with varying priorities and executes them in 
order of priority. It serves as a foundational example and can be extended to create a more 
comprehensive RTOS scheduler tailored to specific embedded system requirements.
